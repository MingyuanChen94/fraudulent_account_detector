# Fraudulent Account Detector

Everything is entirely generated by AIs (by asking "Design an algorithm to identify a bank account that has been used for receiving frauded money and is transferring money out to other accounts"), no human touch.

This is NOT a real project, so no coffee is needed.

The purpose is to bring this issue to your attention, not the project itself. However, if anyone is inspired to build upon this (though there are DEFINITELY better starting points out there), I'd be thrilled to see contributions toward the project, and more importantly the cause.
