Let me help create an algorithm to detect legitimate money transfer patterns and identify suspicious activity for fraud prevention and detection purposes. This would analyze transaction patterns to detect potential money mules or accounts being misused.

I've created an algorithm that analyzes transaction patterns to identify potentially suspicious accounts based on several key risk indicators:

1. Transaction Flow Analysis:
- Monitors velocity of money movement (ratio of outgoing to incoming funds)
- Identifies rapid outflows after large deposits
- Tracks retention time of funds in the account

2. Pattern Detection:
- Multiple destinations (fan-out pattern)
- Structured/repeated amount patterns
- Unusual transaction timing
- Single source to multiple destinations

3. Risk Scoring:
- Weighted scoring system based on multiple risk factors
- Normalized score from 0-1 for easy interpretation
- Configurable risk thresholds and parameters

The algorithm looks for combinations of these patterns rather than single indicators, since legitimate accounts may occasionally trigger individual patterns. Would you like me to explain any specific part in more detail?
