**Fraudulent Bank Account Detection Algorithm**

### Overview
The goal of this algorithm is to identify bank accounts that have received 
fraudulent funds and are subsequently transferring those funds to other 
accounts. This algorithm will utilize a combination of machine learning 
techniques, data analysis, and rule-based systems to detect suspicious 
activity.

### Data Requirements
To implement this algorithm, the following data sources are required:

1. **Transaction history**: A database containing all transactions 
(deposits and withdrawals) for each bank account.
2. **Account information**: A database containing demographic and 
financial information about each account holder.
3. **Fraudulent activity reports**: A database of known fraudulent 
activities, including account numbers and transaction IDs.

### Algorithm Components
The algorithm consists of the following components:

#### 1. Data Preprocessing
* Clean and preprocess the transaction history data by removing any 
duplicates or missing values.
* Convert all dates to a standard format (e.g., YYYY-MM-DD).
* Normalize the transaction amounts to prevent bias towards large 
transactions.

#### 2. Feature Engineering
Extract relevant features from the preprocessed data, including:
* **Incoming transaction count**: The number of incoming transactions for 
each account within a specified time window (e.g., last 30 days).
* **Outgoing transaction count**: The number of outgoing transactions for 
each account within a specified time window.
* **Average incoming transaction amount**: The average amount of incoming 
transactions for each account.
* **Average outgoing transaction amount**: The average amount of outgoing 
transactions for each account.
* **Transaction velocity**: The rate at which transactions are occurring 
(e.g., number of transactions per hour).
* **Account age**: The age of the account in days.

#### 3. Anomaly Detection
Utilize machine learning algorithms to identify accounts with unusual 
transaction patterns:
* **Isolation Forest**: Train an isolation forest model on the 
feature-engineered data to detect anomalies.
* **Local Outlier Factor (LOF)**: Calculate the LOF for each account to 
determine its similarity to neighboring accounts.

#### 4. Rule-Based System
Implement a rule-based system to flag accounts that meet specific 
conditions:
* **Incoming transaction threshold**: Flag accounts with an unusually high 
number of incoming transactions within a specified time window.
* **Outgoing transaction threshold**: Flag accounts with an unusually high 
number of outgoing transactions within a specified time window.
* **Transaction amount threshold**: Flag accounts with transactions 
exceeding a certain amount (e.g., $10,000).

#### 5. Scoring and Ranking
Assign a score to each account based on the anomaly detection and 
rule-based system results:
* **Anomaly score**: Calculate an anomaly score for each account using the 
isolation forest and LOF models.
* **Rule-based score**: Assign a score based on the number of rules 
triggered by each account.
* **Total score**: Combine the anomaly score and rule-based score to 
obtain a total score.

#### 6. Thresholding and Alert Generation
Set a threshold for the total score, above which an account is considered 
suspicious:
* **Alert generation**: Generate alerts for accounts with scores exceeding 
the threshold.

### Example Use Case

Suppose we have a bank account with the following characteristics:

| Feature | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Incoming transaction count (last 30 days) | 10 |
| Outgoing transaction count (last 30 days) | 5 |
| Average incoming transaction amount | $1,000 |
| Average outgoing transaction amount | $500 |
| Transaction velocity (transactions per hour) | 0.5 |
| Account age (days) | 60 |

The isolation forest model assigns an anomaly score of 0.8, indicating a 
high likelihood of unusual activity. The rule-based system flags the 
account for exceeding the incoming transaction threshold and transaction 
amount threshold. The total score is calculated as:

Total score = Anomaly score + Rule-based score
= 0.8 + (2 x 1) // two rules triggered
= 2.8

If the threshold is set to 2.5, this account would generate an alert for 
further investigation.

### Code Implementation

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.ensemble import IsolationForest
from sklearn.neighbors import LocalOutlierFactor

def preprocess_data(transaction_history):
    # Clean and preprocess transaction history data
    transaction_history = transaction_history.drop_duplicates()
    transaction_history['date'] = 
pd.to_datetime(transaction_history['date'])
    return transaction_history

def feature_engineering(transaction_history):
    # Extract relevant features from preprocessed data
    incoming_transaction_count = 
transaction_history.groupby('account_id')['incoming_transactions'].count()
    outgoing_transaction_count = 
transaction_history.groupby('account_id')['outgoing_transactions'].count()
    average_incoming_amount = 
transaction_history.groupby('account_id')['incoming_amount'].mean()
    average_outgoing_amount = 
transaction_history.groupby('account_id')['outgoing_amount'].mean()
    return pd.DataFrame({
        'incoming_transaction_count': incoming_transaction_count,
        'outgoing_transaction_count': outgoing_transaction_count,
        'average_incoming_amount': average_incoming_amount,
        'average_outgoing_amount': average_outgoing_amount
    })

def anomaly_detection(features):
    # Utilize machine learning algorithms to detect anomalies
    isolation_forest = IsolationForest(contamination=0.1)
    lof = LocalOutlierFactor(n_neighbors=20, contamination=0.1)
    isolation_forest.fit(features)
    lof.fit(features)
    return isolation_forest.decision_function(features), 
lof.fit_predict(features)

def rule_based_system(features):
    # Implement a rule-based system to flag accounts
    incoming_threshold = 10
    outgoing_threshold = 5
    amount_threshold = 10000
    flags = []
    for index, row in features.iterrows():
        if row['incoming_transaction_count'] > incoming_threshold:
            flags.append(1)
        elif row['outgoing_transaction_count'] > outgoing_threshold:
            flags.append(1)
        elif row['average_incoming_amount'] > amount_threshold or 
row['average_outgoing_amount'] > amount_threshold:
            flags.append(1)
        else:
            flags.append(0)
    return pd.Series(flags)

def scoring_and_ranking(anomaly_scores, rule_based_flags):
    # Assign a score to each account based on anomaly detection and 
rule-based system results
    total_scores = anomaly_scores + (rule_based_flags * 2) // two rules 
triggered
    return total_scores

def thresholding_and_alert_generation(total_scores, threshold):
    # Set a threshold for the total score and generate alerts for accounts 
exceeding it
    alerts = []
    for index, score in total_scores.items():
        if score > threshold:
            alerts.append(index)
    return alerts

# Example usage
transaction_history = pd.read_csv('transaction_history.csv')
features = feature_engineering(preprocess_data(transaction_history))
anomaly_scores, _ = anomaly_detection(features)
rule_based_flags = rule_based_system(features)
total_scores = scoring_and_ranking(anomaly_scores, rule_based_flags)
alerts = thresholding_and_alert_generation(total_scores, 2.5)

print(alerts) // List of account IDs that generated alerts
```

Note: This code implementation is a simplified example and may require 
modifications to suit specific use cases and data requirements. 
Additionally, the performance of the algorithm can be improved by 
fine-tuning the parameters of the machine learning models and adjusting 
the threshold values.
